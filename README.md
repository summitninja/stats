# This repo contains stats functions written in python

# How to use

Most functions are written in jupyter notebooks and can be either downloaded and put in a local jupyter notebook server or opened in a cloud service.

Some of the many services I have used:
- Online - Google colab (https://colab.research.google.com/github/summitninja/stats/blob/master/)
- local - If python is installed you can pip install jupyterlab(https://jupyter.org/install)
- local - VS code has a easy to use extension that is installed with python(https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)
