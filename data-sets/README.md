Feel free to use this data to get a feel for working with larger data sets! it has tons of real world event and situations
Context: there are two 10k gallon tanks with two sensors that read the distance to the bottom of the tank and convert it to how many gallons are currently in it. This data set is one of those sensors with a unix time stamp of when the data was collected
Would love to see neat things anyone see in the data!
